This project is aimed at C++ developers who want to use V8 Embedded in their applications.

CProxyV8 provide an easy way to expose properties and methods from C++ classes to Java Script using V8 engine without the need to specify callbacks for each item.

= Objectives =

1. Avoid the need of specifics callbacks declarations required by V8 and replace it by hidden generic callbacks directly to the object instance.

2.Provide an easy way to expose properties from C++ objects to Java Script V8

3. Provide an easy way to expose methods from C++ objects to Java Script V8

4. Avoid the need of MACROS to declare types or keep tracking of all classes. The compiler must take care of this with the templates.

5. Achive this without modification of V8 code.
