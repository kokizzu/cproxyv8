Very Important Issue, please be carefully

= Invalid Memory References =

_I can not be more panic about this issue.. *lol*_

This library allow you to expose objects from C++ directly to the Java Script, this will lead to the possible following situation (see the Usage page to check the code):

Java Script shell:
{{{
   >end = line.getEnd();   
}}}

When the code exec this, the instance Point who belongs to Line is now exposed to Java Script and can be accessed directly.

{{{
   >end.x = 10;   
}}}

Now the PROBLEM: if line is disposed by the garbage collector or by the C++ program, end will be pointed to an invalid reference. When line is disposed the instance of point inside is disposed too.

=Usage solutions=

Do not expose references to this internal objects, unless you are complete sure that they are going to be available all the times.

=Possible Implementation Solutions=

I still thinking how to solve the problem, main idea is to add listeners in both sides to synchronized the disposal process.
